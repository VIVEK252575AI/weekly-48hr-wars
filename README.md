#⚔️ weekly-48hr-wars
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“One topic. 48 hours. Full focus. Every week.” If I win these small weekly wars, I’ll win the long game. No distractions. No shortcuts. Just code, growth, and proof-of-work.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A focused, no-excuses coding series where I dedicate 48 hours every week (Monday & Tuesday) to **master one core DSA or development topic** — through real problem-solving, repetition, and deep reflection.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

This repo is part of my **Underground Era** — my quiet grind phase to level up as a developer, build mastery, and become interview-ready by pushing consistent, intense effort every week.

I'm not here to just "watch tutorials."

I'm here to:
- Solve hundreds of real problems 💻
- Build reusable code patterns 🛠️
- Track my growth, mistakes & progress 📈
- And ultimately — **outgrow my past self**
